# Mentor sessions repository

## Before running:
- Please use `pnpm` instead of `npm` otherwise the scripts will not work.

## This repository contains:
- Examples of testing, including frontend, backend, and end-to-end testing.
  - I used the following technologies to demonstrate testing a web app:
    - Vitest as the test runner (for all tests except end-to-end tests).
    - React Testing Library for frontend testing.
    - Playwright for end-to-end testing. Other options might include Selenium or Cypress.
    - While I did not use it in this repository, I suggest using the supertest library for backend integration testing of API routes.
- Examples of Git usage from a previous mentor session.
